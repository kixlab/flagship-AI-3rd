What shall we do
We could sit here in silence for thirty minutes try
That would make him feel terrible
We could sit here mouth it so he would think there's nothing registering
Are those books part it
Oh
no
that's something I was just reading before here
Oh
I see
Are you student here
Yes
in political science
And you're in psychology
Yeah
I'm graduate student here
Yes
me too
Guess I heard
I guess you knew the person down the hall who asked you what you were doing here at this hour
Right
Funny
I don't know his name
I see him here all the time
I'm real friendly him
but I think he's like fifth or sixth year student
I don't really know his name
I don't even know if he's in clinical
but I always talk him
How long have you been here
This is my second year
Second year
To go back that far start over I'd love chance
What year are you in
I'm finishing my fourth
I'm gonna be out in one more year
Anyway my wife has said that I get year from August then she quits work
she said Now you can keep going school but you think
you support me
Yeah
That kind thing
She claims she's putting in her time now so it's up me
Is she planning go back school when she finishes
She isn't planning do anything for while
I think
Which is probably the best attitude
I uh I don't know uh what kind chance I'm gonna have looking for job unless the
Uh yeah
They say history English are bad
Political science isn't far behind as far as jobs go
I don't think
Yeah
I'm hoping get job in Washington maybe
They pay the best
Do you have any idea what you want be doing
Nyah
As long as you get job
It's at that point
yeah
I really like teach
I'd like teach at small college
I like teaching more than doing research
I think
Mm
But those jobs are so hard find anymore
they're not as separable anymore
Yeah
that's true
so you can't take one over the other
You go do both
so I'm not real optimistic about the job situation
Right
My a musician
Oh
really
Yeah
he has the same problem
Like he's always known all his life what he wants do
Uh huh
You know
he says from the time he was like in junior high he knew he wanted be musician
he said he knew he was gonna starve at it but he just wanted do it
So uh he's doing what your wife is doing now
you know
Mm hm
He's staying out school so I can go school
then he wants go school
uh get degree
then look for job
He wants play in an orchestra
but it's the same thing
you know
Yes
Hello
Hello
Darleen
Hello
Jean
Yeah
Yeah
I was just ringing up say I'll be coming down in moment
Oh
good
Good
Yeah
Yes
Yes
Mm
Where did you get last night
Last I didn't I didn't go anywhere
Well
Matthew rang see if you were here
Oh
Oh
Well
was it last night
Yes
That's right
it was last night
No
I'd taken Ivan the sport center in
Oh
forgotten
And I left note
No
I left note for Matthew saying
I left
Because I know he's little devil
you know
So I I had left note say that I'd be back soon
And I put the time on it
I said I've just taken Ivan the center
Yes
The sport center
Ah
And well
what time was it
Oh
I left here at about twenty five
I don't know what time it was
Jean
I can't remember really
Yes
I left here at twenty five
there was nobody in
Now I thought he would have come with me
you see
Yes
Yes
And I've I picked Ivan up at ten
And then I took
Well
I had go fairly slow Saltbourne with the roads being bad
Yes
it would be
yes
Then I got back
I stopped in town just buy some butter
cause I was out butter
Yeah
And I came home
Well
he was in tears
So that was it
Oh
I don't know why
Don't know what had upset him so
Oh dear
But I hadn't been gone that long
I was back there before six
No
No
Oh
Heck
And I rang Joyce up last night thinking she was having her teeth out see how she was
you know
John had gone London for an interview
She was out at the club
wasn't she
left Susan on her own
who is only ten
Yes
be on her own til about half past eleven
This is really who
Oh
Well
this is it
Well
in fact Kerry was playing in the chess tournament
And he didn't get in
So I didn't go typing last night
Didn't you
No
Well
I can't leave him for two hours if I'm if he's crying when I've left him for one
No
Oh
Dear me
you know
as I say I didn't get typing
Oh
you're tied down
well
aren't you
Well
I am really
Yeah
Yeah
Yes
you know
cause he hates being on his own
Yeah
For some peculiar reason he always knows where I'm going approximately what time I'll be
I mean
Yeah
Yes
Okay
Yes
You know
Yes
Yes
This is really crazy
but always bothering me
Not well
ever since I've been older
It's that I don't really tend take my frustrations out on anyone but my mother
Okay
And that's crazy
I don't know why
With everyone else I can just be really easy going
you know
uh not let things upset me
or if they do I don't show it
I just keep it myself
but when I go home all hell breaks loose
you know
I just And it's really
it's bad
And we're real close
we always have been since I've been little
It was more like friends
Whenever she'd spank me we'd laugh
I wasn't anything like that
you know
I guess in way I was kind spoiled
But it concerns me when I do that
cause I know it hurts her when I go home act like that
cause I don't see her that often
I don't do it my father
It's just my mom
I wonder why
you know
Why why can't I be the same type person with her
And I wonder whether if it's split personality or whatever
you know
I don't know that much about that
Did you ever stop think that maybe it's because you your mother are so close
That could be
Um And you say you were like friends
Oh
yeah
Then most likely you were happy when you were with her
so naturally she'd be the person you'd take your trouble also
Right
right
That's about the only thing I can think
cause I know my momma I get into arguments
Yeah
it's sort like it makes her sad that sort thing
it's kind hard for us relate on things that are part our day age that really weren't part hers
you know
And that's usually where the problems arise
But not only that just whenever I get upset I take it out on her
just I won't talk
or I'll just be real moody
And I don't know
I'm never like that around my friends
I don't like that
I think that's pretty bad
I guess I'll summarize
Okay
Um basically what you're speaking is um your relationship with your mother the extent that she seems be the only person you can take your frustrations out on
Uh hm
And um you relate your friends the effect that you're always boisterous so speak around them
but whenever you get home all hell breaks loose between you your mom
as you say
And I think it's basically because your close relationship with your mother more or less as friends
Mm hm
Also as mother daughter relationship
Right
Do you realize what crappy life that is
Going school five days week plus work on weekends
then I wanna take this special Saturday class
But you'll be doing the things you want do
Right
Taking special classes you like buying some your own clothes without your craziness
Uh huh
And if you get nice job you'll be making money
you'll have such feeling freedom
you can go buy what you want without your father telling you what do
Right
But the class is four hours every Saturday
they're like from they're like from 9 0 0 1 0 0 EE they're like from 9 0 0 1 0 0 EE
then go work like from then go work like from 2 0 0 8 0 0 DE then go work like from 2 0 0 8 0 0 DE
I dunno
God
do you realize what crappy life that is
And I've been studying five hours every weekday without fail
I'll be totally totally wiped out
be crappy life
Wait second
What's this about five hours
Are you serious
Two used be enough
Are you exaggerating
No
honest
Mom
I just need make sure
What
Make sure what
Well
maybe I'm not sure
I don't understand it too much
I don't wanna become some stupid woman who can't do anything but hang around the house wait for sales
That's crappy
It's not really clear
but you do know what kind woman you don't want
Well
Well
yeah
but it's sorta I should be learning more
I just wanna learn
Sounds like the important thing is learn
But it confuses me
cause your grades are good
I just don't know what's gotten into you
I've been wanting tell you
What's gotten into you
I don't understand it
I wanna study all the time
Maybe I just wanna learn
It's new uh new thing with me
I'll say it's new
I can't believe it
Well
Maybe by now I should be getting used sudden changes in you
You are growing up in hurry
So now you're regular young scholar who wants learn
huh
Yeah
I need
wanna learn
sorta because there's this urge in me know more
you know
I guess
Sorta like you need do it
A strong urge
It is an urge
I just have do it
Feel terrible when I don't
Something got into me that I want A's badly
Oh
it's good grades that you're after
I want good grades badly
I have get them
I've just got get my grades
grades
So you'll get them if you
It's like I've got get them save my life or something
Like life would be totally crappy without them
uh like sometimes I get scared I won't get into college
Oh
that's what's going on
You're scared about college
It's not scared
it's like uh
well
maybe scared
Scared missing my friends
Old dumb Sandra says Everybody who's going Northwestern is going the prep class
She says Lon Marion Jimmy Doug all signed up
It's ridiculous
I'm like sheep following the pack
Worrying about my SAT scores
That's where I got this ridiculous urge
Yeah
that's what's got into me
Yeah
So I see
It's not Little Miss Scholarship with an urge learn
What's got into you is following your friends Northwestern
Not exactly
It's for me too
I'd miss Jimmy the most
He's so o o interesting
We could talk all night long
He's gonna be great designer
There's something neat about the way he
Wait second
Are you telling me that the five hours your new passion for learning is also passion for Jimmy
I wouldn't call it passion
but yeah
I wanna be with my friends
Maybe that's what this study urge is all about
Sounds like you want be with your friend
Oh
Mom
he's not everything
I didn't say everything
Let's just call it an urge
Mom
Mom
pick up
Are you gonna pick up
Yeah
I'm here
I was outside
Let me catch my breath
So you had an important question about you Jimmy
Yeah
How is he
Oh
he's fine
Then then I was just wondering
you know
we've been going together for long time
right
Uh months several months
Well
I was just wondering about getting close
he wants get closer
that's probably not for me
He wants it
you're not sure
Yeah
you know
we kiss goodnight like I told ya
he feels like wanting more closeness
it's not for me
He wants more closeness than goodnight kiss
but you don't
It's not exactly that I don't want more
It might not be for me
Actually it's confusing
So what you want say is that you do want closeness you don't want closeness
Exactly
And it worries me
I might want go farther
But you're confused
Yeah
sometimes I want
but don't know about the closeness
It's scary
Oh
scared more that goodnight kiss
I'm not scared LITTLE more than a goodnight kiss
but LOT more might uh you know
A little more is okay
well
lot is even hard talk about
Oh
Mom
it gets me so miserable
It's gonna be totally impossible not get close
Oh
baby
thinking someday going farther makes you so miserable
Wish I could hug you now
It's not someday
it was last night
Huh
What
Last night we got closer
it scared me
Ah
Dennie
I didn't know
Poor thing
What's going on
We've been uh
It's like been sensitive all that stuff
But we've sorta gotten into petting
Like we care for each other
there's an attraction heavy petting like that
So fine
fine
That he's sensitive
that he's caring
But I wanna help with what's frightening
If it's about how your body works you know all that already
Or is there some
is it something you forgot
No
I'm just not ready go all the way
You're afraid going all the way
Because it's getting pregnant I'm not ready handle
But anyway at this stage my life I don't feel emotionally
I'd just feel strange afterward
Not ready
Maybe I wouldn't
I don't know
Sometimes I think Am I too young am I too old or am I okay
I mean
my friends were all through it at 1 5
You mean they're no longer virgins
Oh
different things happened
One feels fine about it
She didn't mind it
Uh she uses the pill
And it's no big deal
She her guy are solid
All the others are loose
It doesn't matter them
But it matters you
Sherry sometimes goes with different guys
I met this one
he was nerd
She makes him use rubber all that
but it doesn't sound like great fun always
It doesn't sound like it would be great fun for me
It's not for you
Let Sherry pop into bed with every jerk with nice smile come away dissatisfied
With you it's got be closeness love first the real thing or nothing
Well
it doesn't sound like great fun anyway
She says it's not always nice for her
sometimes it is
Sometimes she learns about herself
You know
she's really careful about
Careful
Always going with different guys
When you lie down with dogs you get up with fleas
Sleep with jerks become jerk
You're right
it's like getting initiated into new life new phase life
You become woman even though you're not woman
Uh you know how I mean that
Dennie
Uh it's
yeah
It's almost like going into womanhood
Almost like it
But it's very strange from where I am in life
It's like someone has been inside your body where nobody else has ever been before
It's very strange be so vulnerable
You're invaded
changed forever
This private most private place in you like private room in your home You wouldn't want just anyone in there
It feels weird deal with that just very weird
Kind odd letting someone inside you
You don't know how feel about it
Makes you little uncomfortable
No
it makes you feel VERY weird cause never in the history the world has anyone been inside me before invaded me
It feels very VERY weird
A once in lifetime change
Forever
It seems
I don't know
It probably goes all the way back into my childhood
My mother told me that I was the pet my father
Although I never realized it
I mean
they never treated me as pet at all
And other people always seemed think I was sort a priviledged one in the family
But I never had any reason think so
And as far as I can see looking back on it now it's just that the family let the other kids get away with more than they usually did me
And it seems for some reason have held me a more rigid standard than they did the other children
You're not so sure you were pet in any sense
but more that the family situation seemed hold you pretty high standards
M hm
That's just what has occurred me
that other people could sorta make mistakes or do things as children that were naughty or that was just boyish prank or that was just what you might expect
but Alice wasn't supposed do those things
M hm
With somebody else it would just be just oh be little naughtiness
but as far as you were concerned it shouldn't be done
That's really the idea I've had
I think the whole business my standards or my values is one that I need think about rather carefully
since I've been doubting for long time whether I even have any sincere ones
M hm
Not sure whether you really have any deep values which you are sure
M hm
M hm
You've been doubting that for some time
Well
I've experienced that before
Though one thing when I make decisions I don't have
I don't think
It seems that some people have have quite steady values that they can weigh things against when they want make decision
Well
I don't
I haven't had
I guess I'm an opportunist
I do what seems be the best thing do at the moment
let it go at that
You have no certain measuring rods that you can use
Yes
M hm
That's what I feel
Is our time about up
Mr L
Well
I think there are several minutes more
Sasha
That's the third time I've asked what happened the remote control
I'm getting frustrated
I didn't hear you cause I'm reading
Do you mind
Ah
c'mon
I practically shouted in your ear
You're just grumpy wanting start trouble cause you ate that dumb stuff for breakfast
And now low blood sugar has vacuumed all the energy from your brain
That's all you know low blood sugar all the time
you've got sugar on the brain
And you're vacuum brain
Maybe I'm imagining it
but it seems like you've been moody for the last hour
Usually you don't get so annoyed when my shots go wild
I really threw some ugly ones
but I've done it before
all I got was pity not being called stupid or ox paws
Maybe your body needs some more fuel
Did you remember do good breakfast
Mom made me some French toast
but it was just too yucky inside
so I had orange juice stuff
Stuff
A couple cookies
Well
you know
that's not gonna nourish you all the way lunch
maybe I'd better make you cheese sandwich now
It could be something else
but bad breakfast might be giving you bad mood
I can't be sure that's it cause
Ah
c'mon
you CAN be sure
I'm sure
You're just trying say it nice so I'll understand
Their damn ladder climbing is nuisance everybody
That burning ambition fills their lives they simply stop thinking creatively
I get bored with these kids always worrying about getting ahead
Every one em is boring even
Why don't you tell em that they're hurting their careers by trying be inventive on rushed ambitious schedule
Tell em
Listen
Lou
I spend half my time nagging em put scientific curiosity up uh ahead publishing
When I talk about science over job security they say it's like committing academic suicide
God
they must think I'm old fashioned
Oh
I know they don't say it
but it's obvious they think I'm living in the 5 0 s don't appreciate the pressue they're under
I really do
But both my post docs most my grad students just want publish prematurely
They even want to it with half assed data
They're not driven get the bottom things
Maybe they need watch you work more closely learn the pitfalls
Marie
I've been taking Laurie through all my struggles with the adolescent study
I showed her my false starts the dead ends how some spurious correlations got me barking up the wrong tree
She says that's helped her comb her data more carefully before she writes
Every Thursday morning last quarter I took the whole bunch em through every lost battle we had on the coping styles project
God
they still came up with crap
I don't know what's going on
How can I help them
Am I too demanding
Are these kids scared I don't see it
Have they lost their curiosity
They're supposed be gifted researchers
all they think about is quick publications get promotions
Career development above all
Honest I'm getting so sick the whole thing
Listen
Marie
you've just gotta see that they can't survive being like you
They can't all be as meticulous as you
They don't have your security your tenure your talent
They don't have your experience yet
And it's time for you stop aggravating yourself getting all exhausted everything over the fact that these kids don't have the leisure or whatever
They don't have turn out impeccable inventive articles
You've got accept the fact that only uh maybe one twenty will end up doing something really useful
You're right
Lou
They're still green scared
but it it tears me apart see uh what's happening in the journals
Our field is getting so self absorbed so political proliferated with this useless ritualistic research everyone wanting do their version every damn thing
It's hell a time have retire
I was hoping get just few just couple young people around me who'd have what it takes buck the trend
That's all
It's an awful situation
This the first time I've been teary since Edward died
What are we do when you invite us here then you drive big cars as if we with small cars are not existing
Why are you so sure it's the big fault
But there is truth this thing these people who love the cars ostentatious
how do you say
They think that theirs is the road
We have few grande uglies in Buenos Aires
but you have so many
Don't look at me
I've got an old Fiat that me my boyfriend keep together with bent coathangers
I wouldn't trade it for one those gas guzzling Cadillacs
Wonderful
You honor my country by being Fiat owner
but maybe for you it should have been Ferrari or Maserati
Strange you should say that
I was just about buy one each
but they looked too
Us Americans don't enjoy the ostentation 5 0 0 0 0 exotic cars
so I've selected tastefully dented 7 6 Fiat with five forward speeds
Ah
I see
smart lady
You don't depend on the automatic
They're an insult
Automatic transmissions
Yes
You people love them big long automatic Cadillacs that look like uh living room inside
how do you say
Americans don't drive the cars
they live in them
I've noticed how visitors from other countries put Americans down for being preoccupied with bigger is better
you make fun our cars dishwashers technology
It seems as if ah maybe there's jealousy
Do you think
Is true
We envy sometimes your technology
but your reputation is also deserving
we have curvy roads
how do you say
the gas costs so much
so we learn negotiate corners like skiing
Like art is driving skill requiring the and nimble car
We are proud how good is the handling our cars
But you people are rich
have freeways
drive in straight lines
no art
Your cars are clumsy
you think first about how they look
In other countries they think first about how they handle
Sad say
Americans with their freeways money are superficial with cars because they only know the surface them
I done been here all day

It won't block out
Don't you think it's time stop fighting the feelings sorta let them happen

I tried saying myself Hey it's only holiday just tradition I'm hooked on So it'll feel terrible pass over
But then when it actually comes down on me the pain drops me my knees
I forget it'll like stop that the pain will end
Yeah
that's true
It's easy say you're gonna talk yourself out it then really talk yourself out a bad place sorta when ya
I just have let it happen tell myself that's just the way it's gonna be wait til March
uh March is
it's our month together cause Carl goes uh
Oh
God
it's so unfair
so she's my own baby
You know
there's this poet who wrote this book poems about losing custody his little girl called it Needle
And in the front it has this old Irish poem about man who's worked himself into frenzy cause he's lost just everything
See
messenger is telling him about how his house burned his wife is dead everything almost is gone
he's sorta um reeling when the messenger finally tells him that his only daughter is gone
This guy says Ay That's the needle in the heart
Well
this thing is the needle in my heart
it's gonna kill me if I can't cut the pain
Gotta figure some way take away some the pain
you take some the pain away by making your own tradition doing your own damn Christmas in March
Your Mary won't care
Why can't you turn December 2 5 th into any day you please
I'd really like talk about my feelings about being an experimental subject
You would
Yeah
Why don't you

I really get peeved by having them required
Okay
Why don't we talk about that then
I liked
well
I didn't want talk about basketball
I didn't like
No
I didn't want talk about that
I don't
my feelings really hadn't gelled about the presidential candidates
Well
I like that
Let's talk about that
Who made up all the requirements
Are they joint decision by the psych department
The requirement for being an experimental subject
Mm hm
I believe there's subjects committee
they have do things within general ethics code
but the general departmental requirement is because they need subjects
there's no other way get subjects
But how accurate do you think your results would be if you use people who are forced participate
I know
Do you feel coerced
Forced participate
Yeah
well
I'm having skip lab this afternoon make it up next week in order get
To get your credit
You're psych 1 0 student
Yes

because I have come all the way over here just look
They put them up haphazardly
there's not system
Lots times I'm coming over here at night
it takes half an hour then half an hour for the experiment
It makes me ill
I know
It makes you resentful
Yeah
it does
It takes me half an hour for half hour experiment
If I happen luck up get it then I have drive over here at night
it's dark cold uh
You feel that you're in danger because you're woman
I don't feel it's so dangerous as
It's just inconvenient
It's very inconvenient
I'm tired
I generally just go through the experiments
I know I'm not giving accurate results

I'm not trying
I don't feel like making myself
Like if I was taking test I'd force myself focus my attention on it
but in the experiments I'm just barely reading
What about the debriefing
Do you pay attention after the experiment
I'm just sitting there saying I don't give damn I just want get out here
Yeah
Do you see another reason why the department want psych 1 0 students be experimental subjects
I see the reason
Maybe they want them have some experience in an experimental lab
Take part in the ongoing research taking place here
It's also like an invasion your privacy
Yeah
I'm just sitting here for half an hour now
That means I'll have do that 1 0 times
Whatever I'm going learn in one half hour it's really for the psych department
You don't think you learned anything you didn't learn in the first half hour
No
Not through getting all these different experimental experiences
No
I don't think that's helped me any
I'm not psych major
I don't intend be
Maybe if I was interested I could talk the experimenter
but I just don't care
This is my last semester
I just want get through
Which experiment is this for you
This will make my third hour
I'll have do two more hours
How do you feel right now about being in this one
Do you hate this one
Well
I don't particularly hate this one
I'm not as peeved as I have been
I'm not as tired
That makes lot difference
When I'm tired I know I don't give good results
I know lot people just make designs on their papers
They don't even read the question
Really
Now you know that they don't get good results
Do you think they try screw up the experiments
I know people who try screw up the experiment
I know great deal people who try screw up the results

No
They don't even read the questions
They just make designs on their papers randomly haphazardly
So how can the results be valid
That's real problem
So why do they even do them
they just limit the requirement two hours or something
By the time I get through ten these things I'm not very willing cooperate
I've been in an experiment
I kind enjoy them
When I was an undergraduate I was in GSR experiment
I was quite enthusiastic
because I had never been in an experiment before
You weren't forced be in it
were you
No
I wasn't forced be in it
You were psych major
Yes
I was psych major
See
you had an interest in it
You're interested in it for your own benefit
I'm not interested in it
I'm taking this course because I have take this course
It's just requirement
Not only did you feel you have be in the experiment
but you had be in the course
your feelings have do with the whole thing what the requirement is
I don't really mind being required be in the course
I just feel this extra stuff is unnecessary
You don't think this is truly an integral part the course
No
I feel like it's little click little Catch 2 2 attached it
You don't get any credit
It breaks up your time
conflicts with tests
But because we've got you in corner you have put up with it
There's nothing you can do
Okay
what can I do
I can not participate
Then it goes on my record as an F
There is one thing you can do
Okay
I could write paper
Yeah
That's not reasonable alternative
It's not
No
Design research experiment
Tell me more about it
That's interesting
You know perfectly
No
I don't
Tell me
I've had people take it
That take the alternative
Yeah
Write research paper that would take 2 0 3 0 hours
No
it doesn't
Have you looked into it
I've looked into it
It's just two pages
Our instructor pointed out that it would be lot more work than it would be do the experiments
Dr King pointed out that
Dr King is your instructor
Yes
If we chose that route it would be more work
Uh huh
A two page paper
You mean I've been through all this shit for nothing
Well
I think you have read something experimental write paper on it
But he implied
Just critique or something
He doesn't grade it
It's just matter doing it or not doing it
I'm not sure
I know people who have taken that alternative
Can you mix it up in any way
Some people do
I've heard people doing it
That's something you could take up with David Drachman
Do you feel better now
God
If I could have done that I would have gone one weekend
gotten all this garbage over with
How does that make you feel about being in this experiment
It makes me feel like getting up walking out
Really
Do you really feel like getting up walking out
Well
What would happen if you walked out
I don't know
You could if you wanted
That's right
I'd be disappointed if you did
Oh
sure
No
because I like being subject in this experiment
I want find out what they're going say us
I don't like being in experiments
I don't like coming over here
They're inconvenient
I don't like the idea that someone is looking at you trying figure you out
Psych you out
Yeah
They don't have the ability look inside your brain
but I don't like being looked at under microscope
Because it's an invasion your privacy
It is an invasion privacy
I don't like being poked picked at like an insect

my nose just gets stopped up
Okay
Has it been all stopped up
or has it been running loose too
Um hmm
Loose too

Okay
Let me just take listen your breathing for second
Take deep breath for me
Good
And again
again
Good
I'm gonna take look in your ear


Okay
I'm gonna go back
take another look at this one
What I'm seeing is that this ear has some fluid in it
And it's probably fluid that's caught in here that makes it feel stuffed up
Okay
Open your mouth wide for me
Say ahh
Say ahh again
there
Uh uh
Doesn't hurt
Okay
And down here
Doesn't bother you
Okay
Why don't you go ahead get your clothes back on
I'll sit talk you for second
I'm gonna be out
Okay
Let me explain you what I've seen
Um it looks like what you've got is congestion
And your eardrum is sort pulled back tight
you know
we talk about the eardrum that we see at the back the canal
And how that happens is the tube that leads it gets swollen gets closed off
It's usually not open like this
but it gets all swollen up
Um hum
It closes off
then the ear comes back
there's like vacuum there
And it's real tight
they hurt
they're pulled back
And that's cause all the congestion that you're having
it's probably giving you the feeling dizziness
Your throat doesn't look real bad
It doesn't look like you have strep throat
An you may even have little bit sinus problems on top that
It's hard tell
What I'd like do is start you on some
Now there's not bad infection in there
And the should help just relieve this congestion
should help open up your nose So that you can breathe
Okay
Um they do different things for different people
some people they help more than others
When I use it it usually does fine for me
When other people try it it doesn't do as well
But I expect especially with the nose problem that this will really help you lot
And once you get that cleared out your ears cleared out I think you'll start feel lot better
And I think you should be ready probably come back tomorrow
You don't have fever
I don't think it's bad infection
So we'll have see how you do
Mm hm
I think it's just virus
And if we can get you over this congestion I think you'll feel lot better
So I'll give you the prescription
Do you need pharmacy card
Do you want charge it
or how are you gonna handle it
I'm going charge it
Okay
Then we'll give you pharmacy card
And uh if you're not better in two days you can come back
we'll take another look at you
But I think you'll probably feel much better with this be able work tomorrow
I'm going stay out tomorrow make sure
Okay
Now these aren't easy
have you ever used these drops before
No
Okay
You tilt your head back
drop two in each nostril
Okay
Sometimes it's
it's good get good angle
And put your head back
Otherwise they'll run
Breathe them in
It's going sting
Breathe it in
hold it in for second
Okay
And then because you don't want blow it right out again breathe in
hold it in for while
work better
And it'll tell you on the bottle how take it
You take it every 4 6 hours as much as you need
Do you have any questions at all
Um um
Okay
Don't you go giving this your brothers sisters
Or I'll tell them who did it
Okay
Okay
