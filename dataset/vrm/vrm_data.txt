   Whenever she'd spank me, we'd laugh.                     DE

   I don't do it to my father.                              DE
   It's just to my mom,                                     EE

   you know.                                                RD
   Why, why can't I be the same type of person with her.    QD
   And I wonder whether if it's a split personality or      MM
   whatever,                                                DD

  it's sort of like it makes her sad and that sort of thing,EE
 [1] and it's kind of hard for us to relate on,             MM
 [2] you know,                                              MM
 [1] things that are a part of our day and age that really  MM

   on her                                                   DD

   But ...                                                  MM
L: I guess I'll summarize.                                  DD
D: (laughs) Okay.                                           IK
L: Um, basically what you're speaking of is um (pause) your MM
   relationship with your mother to the extent that she     MM
   seems to be the only person you can take your            MM
   frustrations out on.                                     ER
D: Uh-hm.                                                   KK
L: And, um, you relate to your friends to the effect that   MM
   you're always boisterous, so to speak, around them,      RR
 [1] but whenever you get home,                             MM
 [2] as you say,                                            MM

                                                   [code 2]-RR
   And I think it's basically because of your close         MM
   relationship with your mother more or less as friends.   DI
D: Mm-hm.                                                   KK

Disclosure intent concerns the speaker's experience,        MM
requires no specific presumptions about the other's         MM
experience (Speaker on presumption), and uses the speaker's MM
internal frame of reference.  Thus Disclosures reveal the   MM
speaker's private thoughts, feelings, wishes, perceptions,  MM
and intentions.                                             MM

Edification intent concerns the speaker's experience,       MM
requires no specific presumptions about the other (Speaker  MM
on presumption), and uses a neutral frame of reference that MM
is shared with the other.  To use a frame of reference that MM
is shared with the other without making presumptions about  MM
the other's experience is to use a common, objective frame  MM
of reference that is shared with ANY other.  Thus,          MM
Edifications are statements of fact -- information that is, MM
in principle, public.  Edifications need not, however, be   MM
true or bland.                                              MM

Advisement Intent concerns the speaker's experience (i.e.,  MM
the content is the speaker's idea), it presumes to know whatMM
the other should or must do, think, or feel, and it uses theMM
speaker's frame of reference.  Thus Advisements attempt to  MM
guide the other's behavior, to impose experience on the     MM
other.  Advisements include directives of all kinds, such asMM
commands, suggestions, advice, permission, prohibition.     MM

Confirmation Intent concerns the speaker's experience,      MM
presumes specific knowledge of the other's experience, and  MM
uses a shared frame of reference.  Thus Confirmations       MM
compare the speaker's experience with the other's -- by     MM
expressing shared ideas, memories, or beliefs, or by        MM
agreement or disagreement.  Note that in order to agree or  MM
disagree with someone, it is necessary to presume knowledge MM
of what that person thinks.                                 MM

of that experience accounts for their "seeking" character.  MM
In effect, the speaker attempts to fill a gap in his or her MM
own frame of reference with information to come from other. MM

Acknowledgment Intent concerns the other's experience while MM
presuming no specific knowledge of it (Speaker presumption) MM
and using the other's frame of reference.  Thus, Acknowledg-MM
ments express no content -- they convey only receipt of or  MM
receptiveness to communication from the other.  In effect,  MM
the content of an Acknowledgment is the preceding (or       MM
anticipated) communication from the other.                  MM

Interpretation intent concerns the other's experience and   MM
does presume knowledge of it, but it places this experience MM
in the speaker's frame of reference.  Thus Interpretations  MM
explain or label the other's thoughts and behaviors.  They  MM
include psychological interpretations and judgments or      MM
evaluations of the other, because each of these presumes to MM
view the other's experience (thoughts, feelings, wishes,    MM
perceptions, intentions) from the speaker's perspective.    MM

Reflection intent concerns the other's experience, presumes MM
knowledge of it, and understands this experience within the MM
other's internal frame of reference .  Thus, Reflections putMM
the other's experience (including volitional behavior) into MM
words.  Reflections include repetitions, restatements,      MM
clarifications, and exploratory statements about the other'sMM
experience.  Thus, a Reflection may go well beyond what the MM
other has literally said, providing that its intent is to   MM
portray the other's experience as it is viewed by the other.MM

Uncodable intent is used for incomprehensible or inaudible  MM
utterances, not for utterances that are merely difficult to MM
code.  For difficult utterances, it is usually possible to  MM
narrow the choice to two modes using the classification     MM
principles.  For example, an utterance's focus and source ofMM
experience may be clear even though it's frame of reference MM
is not.  In such cases, it is usually best to choose one of MM
the two possibilities (e.g., Interpretation or Reflection)  MM
rather than calling it Uncodable.  Note that this preserves MM
much of the VRM information (two of the three dimensions).  MM

[Again, the doctor leaves and then returns.]                MM
                                                            MM
Dr: Okay.                                                   IK
    Let me explain to you what I've seen.                   AD
    Um, it looks like what you've got is congestion.        EE
    [1] And your eardrum,                                   MM
    [2] you know,                                           MM
    [3] we talk about the eardrum that we see at the back   MM
    of the canal,                                           MM
    [1] is sort of pulled back tight.                       MM
                                                [code 1]----EE
                                                [code 2]----RE
                                                [code 3]----DE
    And how that happens is the tube that leads to it gets  MM
    swollen and gets closed off.                            EE
    It's usually not open like this,                        EE
    but it gets all swollen up.                             EE
Pt: Um-hum.                                                 KK
Dr: It closes off,                                          EE
    and then, the ear comes back                            EE
    and there's like a vacuum there.                        EE
    And it's real tight                                     EE
    and they hurt                                           EI
    and they're pulled back.                                EE
    And that's cause of all the congestion that you're      MM
    having,                                                 EE
    and it's probably giving you the feeling of dizziness.  EI
    Your throat doesn't look real bad.                      EE
    It doesn't look like you have a strep throat.           EE
    An you may even have a little bit of sinus problems     MM
    on top of that.                                         IE
    It's hard to tell.                                      ED
    What I'd like to do is start you on some nosedrops.     EE
    Now, there's not a bad infection in there.              EE
    And the nosedrops should help just to relieve this      MM
    congestion                                              EE
    [1] and should help open up your nose.                  MM
    [2] Okay?                                               MM
    [1] So that you can breathe.                            MM
                                                [code 1]----EE
                                                [code 2]----QQ
    Um, they do different things for different people,      EE
    and some people they help more than others.             EE
    When I use it it usually does fine for me.              ED
    When other people try it it doesn't do as well.         EE
    But I expect, especially with the nose problem, that    MM
    this will really help you a lot.                        DI
    And once you get that cleared out and your ears         MM
    cleared out, I think you'll start to feel a lot better. DI
    And I think you should be ready probably to come back   MM
    tomorrow.                                               DA
    You don't have a fever,                                 IE
    and I don't think it's a bad infection.                 DE
    So we'll have to see how you do.                        CC
Pt: Mm-hm                                                   KK
Dr: I think it's just a virus.                              DE
    And if we can get you over this congestion I think      MM
    you'll feel a lot better.                               DI
    So, I'll give you the prescription.                     DD
    Do you need a pharmacy card?                            QQ

Pt: I'm going to charge it.                                 DD
Dr: Okay.                                                   IK
    Then we'll give you a pharmacy card.                    DD
    And, uh, if you're not better in two days, you can      MM
    come back                                               AA
    and we'll take another look at you.                     DD
    But I think you'll probably feel much better with this  MM
    and be able to work tomorrow.                           DI
Pt: I'm going to stay out tomorrow to make sure.            DD

    Breathe them in.                                        AA

    Breathe it in,                                          AA

    again, breathe in                                       AA

    It'll work better.                                      EI
