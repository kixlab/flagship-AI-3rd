What shall we do?
We could sit here in silence for thirty minutes and try..
That would make him feel terrible.
We could sit here and mouth it so he would think there's nothing registering.
Are those books part of it?
Oh
no,
that's something I was just reading before here.
Oh,
I see.
Are you a student here?
Yes,
in political science.
And you're in psychology?
Yeah,
I'm a graduate student here.
Yes,
me too.
Guess I heard ...
I guess you knew the person down the hall who asked you what you were doing here at this hour.
Right.
Funny,
I don't know his name!
I see him here all the time,
and I'm real friendly to him,
but I think he's like a fifth or sixth year student,
and I don't really know his name.
I don't even know if he's in clinical,
but I always talk to him.
How long have you been here?
This is my second year.
Second year.
To go back that far and start over I'd love a chance.
What year are you in?
I'm finishing my fourth.
I'm gonna be out in one more year.
Anyway, my wife has said that I get a year from August then she quits work,
and she said "Now you can keep going to school but you think ..."
"... you support me."
Yeah.
That kind of thing.
She claims she's putting in her time now so it's up to me.
Is she planning to go back to school when she finishes?
She isn't planning to do anything for a while,
I think.
Which is probably the best attitude.
I, uh, I don't know uh what kind of chance I'm gonna have looking for a job unless the ...
Uh yeah.
They say history and English are bad.
Political science isn't far behind, as far as jobs go.
I don't think,
Yeah.
I'm hoping to get a job in Washington maybe.
They pay the best.
Do you have any idea what you want to be doing?
Nyah.
As long as you get a job!
It's at that point,
yeah.
I really like to teach.
I'd like to teach at a small college,
I like teaching more than doing research,
I think.
Mm.
But those jobs are so hard to find anymore,
and they're not as separable anymore,
Yeah,
that's true.
so you can't take one over the other.
You go and do both,
so I'm not real optimistic about the job situation.
Right.
My husband's a musician ....
Oh,
really?
Yeah,
and he has the same problem.
Like he's always known all his life what he wants to do.
Uh huh.
You know,
he says from the time he was like in junior high he knew he wanted to be a musician,
and he said he knew he was gonna starve at it, but he just wanted to do it.
So uh he's doing what your wife is doing now.
you know ...
Mm-hm.
He's staying out of school so I can go to school,
and then he wants to go to school
and -- uh -- and get a degree
and then look for a job.
He wants to play in an orchestra,
but it's the same thing,
you know ...
Yes.
Hello.
Hello,
Darleen?
Hello,
Jean?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was just ringing up to say I'll be coming down in a moment.
Oh,
good.
Good.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Mm.
Where did you get to last night?
Last -- I didn't -- I didn't go anywhere.
Well,
Matthew rang to see if you were here.
Oh.
Oh.
Well,
was it last night?
Yes,
That's right,
it was last night.
No.
I'd taken Ivan to the sport center in Saltbourne.
Oh.
He'd forgotten.
And I left a note.
No,
I left a note for Matthew saying --
I left --
Because I know he's a little devil,
you know.
So I -- I had left a note to say that I'd be back soon.
And I put the time on it.
I said I've just taken Ivan to the center.
Yes.
The sport center.
Ah.
And, well,
what time was it?
Oh,
I left here at about twenty to five.
I don't know what time it was,
Jean,
I can't remember really.
Yes,
I left here at twenty to five,
and there was nobody in.
Now I thought he would have come with me,
you see.
Yes.
Yes.
And I've, and I picked Ivan up at ten to.
And then I took --
Well,
I had to go fairly slow to Saltbourne, with the roads being bad.
Yes,
it would be,
yes.
Then I got back,
and I stopped in town just to buy some butter,
'cause I was out of butter.
Yeah.
And I came home.
Well,
he was in tears.
So that was it.
Oh.
I don't know why.
Don't know what had upset him so.
Oh dear.
But I hadn't been gone that long.
I was back there before six.
No.
No.
Oh.
Heck.
And I rang Joyce up last night, thinking she was having her teeth out, to see how she was.
you know,
John had gone to London for an interview,
She was out at the club,
wasn't she,
and left Susan, on her own
who is only ten.
Yes.
She'd be on her own til about half past eleven.
This is really who --
Oh.
Well,
this is it
Well,
in fact, Kerry was playing in the chess tournament.
And he didn't get in
So I didn't go typing last night.
Didn't you.
No.
Well,
I can't leave him for two hours if I'm, if he's crying when I've left him for one.
No.
Oh.
Dear me.
you know,
as I say, I didn't get to typing.
Oh,
you're tied down,
well,
aren't you.
Well,
I am really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes,
you know,
'cause he hates being on his own.
Yeah.
For some peculiar reason, he always knows where I'm going, approximately what time I'll be.
I mean,
Yeah?
Yes.
Okay.
Yes.
You know,
Yes.
Yes.
This is really crazy,
but something's always bothering me.
Not, well,
ever since I've been older.
It's that I don't really tend to take my frustrations out on anyone but my mother.
Okay?
And that's crazy
-- I don't know why.
With everyone else I can just be, really easy going
you know,
and, uh, not let things upset me,
or if they do, I don't show it.
I just keep it to myself,
but when I go home all hell breaks loose,
you know,
and I just --  And it's really
-- it's bad.
And we're real close,
and we always have been since I've been little.
It was more like friends.
Whenever she'd spank me, we'd laugh.
I wasn't anything like that,
you know,
-- I guess, in a way, I was kind of spoiled.
But it concerns me when I do that
'cause I know it hurts her when I go home and act like that
'cause I don't see her that often.
I don't do it to my father.
It's just to my mom,
and I wonder why,
you know.
Why, why can't I be the same type of person with her.
And I wonder whether if it's a split personality or whatever,
you know,
and I don't know that much about that.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe it's because you and your mother are so close?
That could be.
Um.  And you say you were like friends?
Oh,
yeah.
Then most likely you were happy when you were with her
so naturally she'd be the person you'd take your trouble to also.
Right,
right.
That's about the only thing I can think of
'cause I know my momma and I get into arguments.
Yeah,
it's sort of like it makes her sad and that sort of thing,
and it's kind of hard for us to relate on, things that are a part of our day and age that really weren't a part of hers.
you know,
And that's usually where the problems arise.
But not only that just whenever I get upset I take it out on her
-- just I won't talk
or I'll just be real moody.
And I don't know,
I'm never like that around my friends.
I don't like that.
I think that's pretty bad.
I guess I'll summarize.
Okay.
Um, basically what you're speaking of is um   your relationship with your mother to the extent that she seems to be the only person you can take your frustrations out on.
Uh-hm.
And, um, you relate to your friends to the effect that you're always boisterous, so to speak, around them,
but whenever you get home, all hell breaks loose between you and your mom.
as you say,
And I think it's basically because of your close relationship with your mother more or less as friends.
Mm-hm.
Also as mother-daughter relationship.
Right.
Do you realize what a crappy life that is?
Going to school five days a week, plus work on weekends,
and then I wanna take this special Saturday class.
But you'll be doing the things you want to do.
Right?
Taking special classes you like and buying some of your own clothes without your father's craziness.
Uh huh.
And if you get a nice job, you'll be making money
and you'll have such a feeling of freedom
-- you can go buy what you want without your father telling you what to do.
Right.
But the class is four hours every Saturday
-- they're like from -- they're like from 9 00 to 1 00,                       EE to -- they're like from 9 00 to 1 00,                       EE,
then go to work, like from then go to work, like from 2 00 to 8 00?                         DE to then go to work, like from 2 00 to 8 00?                         DE?
I dunno,
God,
do you realize what a crappy life that is?
And I've been studying five hours every weekday without fail.
I'll be totally, totally wiped out.
It'll be a crappy life.
Wait a second.
What's this about five hours?
Are you serious?
Two used to be enough.
Are you exaggerating?
No --
honest,
Mom.
I just need to make sure --
What?
Make sure of what?
Well,
maybe I'm not sure.
I don't understand it too much .
... I don't wanna become some stupid woman who can't do anything but hang around the house and wait for sales.
That's crappy.
It's not really clear,
but you do know what kind of woman you don't want --
Well ...
Well,
yeah,
but ... it's sorta I should be learning more.
I just wanna learn.
Sounds like the important thing is to learn.
But it confuses me,
'cause your grades are good...
I just don't know what's gotten into you.
I've been wanting to tell you --
What's gotten into you?
I don't understand it.
I wanna study all the time.
Maybe I just wanna learn.
It's a new ... uh, new thing with me.
I'll say it's new.
I can't believe it!
Well ...
Maybe by now I should be getting used to sudden changes in you.
You are growing up -- in a hurry.
So now you're a regular young scholar who wants to learn,
huh?
Yeah,
I need to ...
wanna learn ...
sorta because there's this urge in me, to know more
you know,
... I guess.
Sorta like you need to do it?
A strong urge?
It is an urge.
I just have to do it.
Feel terrible when I don't.
Something got into me that I want A's badly.
Oh,
it's good grades that you're after.
I want good grades badly.
I have to get them.
I've just got to get my grades.
Gimmeemy grades!
So you'll get them if you --
It's like I've got to get them to save my life or something.
Like life would be totally crappy without them.
uh, like sometimes I get scared I won't get into college.
Oh,
that's what's going on.
You're scared about college.
It's not "scared" --
it's like ... uh ...
well,
maybe scared.
Scared of missing my friends.
Old dumb Sandra says "Everybody who's going to Northwestern is going to the prep class."
She says Lon, Marion, Jimmy, and Doug all signed up.
It's ridiculous.
I'm like a sheep following the pack.
Worrying about my SAT scores.
That's where I got this ridiculous urge.
Yeah,
that's what's got into me ...
Yeah.
So ... I see.
It's not Little Miss Scholarship with an urge to learn.
What's got into you is following your friends to Northwestern.
Not exactly.
It's for me, too.
I'd miss Jimmy the most.
He's so-o-o interesting.
We could talk all night long.
He's gonna be a great designer.
There's something neat about the way he --
Wait a second.
Are you telling me that the five hours, your new passion for learning, is also a passion for Jimmy?
I wouldn't call it a passion,
but yeah ...
I wanna be with my friends.
Maybe that's what this study urge is all about.
Sounds like you want to be with your friend.
Oh,
Mom,
he's not everything.
I didn't say "everything."
Let's just call it an urge.
Mom ...
Mom ...
pick up.
Are you gonna pick up?
Yeah.
I'm here.
I was outside.
Let me catch my breath.
So, you had an important question about you and Jimmy?
Yeah.
How is he?
Oh,
he's fine. ...
Then ... then I was just wondering --
you know,
we've been going together for a long time,
right?
Uh, months ... several months.
Well,
I was just wondering about getting close --
he wants to get closer --
and that's probably not for me.
He wants it
and you're not sure.
Yeah --
you know,
we kiss goodnight like I told ya
and he feels like wanting more closeness ...
and it's not for me.
He wants more closeness than a goodnight kiss,
but you don't.
It's not exactly that I don't want more.
It might not be for me.
Actually, it's confusing.
So what you want to say is that you do want closeness and you don't want closeness.
Exactly!
And it worries me.
I might want to go farther. ...
But you're confused.
Yeah,
sometimes I want to
but don't know about the closeness.
It's scary.
Oh --
scared of more that a goodnight kiss.
I'm not scared of a LITTLE more than a goodnight kiss,
but a LOT more might -- uh, you know ...
A little more is okay
well,
a lot is even hard to talk about.
Oh,
Mom --
it gets me so miserable.
It's gonna be totally impossible not to get close.
Oh,
baby,
thinking of someday going farther makes you so miserable.
Wish I could hug you now.
It's not someday;
it was last night.
Huh?
What?
Last night ... we ... got closer ...
and it scared me.
Ah,
Dennie.
I didn't know.
Poor thing.
What's going on?
We've been -- uh ...
It's like Jimmy's been sensitive and all that stuff.
But we've sorta gotten into petting. ...
Like, we care for each other --
there's an attraction -- and heavy petting, like that.
So, fine,
fine.
That he's sensitive
and that he's caring.
But I wanna help with what's frightening.
If it's about how your body works, you know all that already.
Or is there some--
is it something you forgot?
No,
I'm just not ready ...   to go all the way.
You're afraid of going all the way.
Because it's getting pregnant I'm not ready to handle.
But, anyway, at this stage of my life, I don't feel emotionally --
I'd just feel strange afterward.
Not ready --
Maybe I wouldn't.
I don't know.
Sometimes I think, "Am I too young, am I too old, or am I okay?"
I mean,
my friends were all through it at 15.
You mean they're no longer virgins.
Oh,
different things happened. ...
One feels fine about it.
She didn't mind it.
Uh, she uses the pill.
And it's no big deal.
She and her guy are solid.
All the others are loose.
It doesn't matter to them.
But it matters to you.
Sherry sometimes goes with different guys.
I met this one,
and he was a nerd.
She makes him use a rubber and all that,
but it doesn't sound like great fun always.
It doesn't sound like it would be great fun for me.
It's not for you.
Let Sherry pop into bed with every jerk with a nice smile and come away dissatisfied.
With you, it's got to be closeness and love first, the real thing or nothing.
Well,
it doesn't sound like great fun anyway.
She says it's not always nice for her --
sometimes it is.
Sometimes she learns about herself.
You know,
she's really careful about --
Careful?
Always going with different guys?
When you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.
Sleep with jerks, become a jerk.
You're right,
it's like getting initiated into a new life -- a new phase of life.
You become a woman, even though you're not a woman. ...
Uh, you know how I mean that,
Dennie?
Uh, it's ...
yeah.
It's almost like going into womanhood.
Almost like it ...
But it's very strange from where I am in life.
It's like someone has been inside your body, where nobody else has ever been before.
It's very strange to be so vulnerable.
You're invaded
and changed forever.
This private, most private ... place in you like a private room in your home. You wouldn't want just anyone in there.
It feels weird to deal with that, just very weird.
Kind of odd, letting someone inside you.
You don't know how to feel about it.
Makes you a little uncomfortable.
No,
it makes you feel VERY weird 'cause never in the history of the world has anyone been inside me before, invaded me.
It feels very, VERY weird.
A once-in-a-lifetime change.
Forever!
It seems -
I don't know -
It probably goes all the way back into my childhood.
My mother told me that I was the pet of my father.
Although I never realized it,
I mean,
they never treated me as a pet at all.
And other people always seemed to think I was sort of a priviledged one in the family.
But I never had any reason to think so.
And as far as I can see looking back on it now, it's just that the family let the other kids get away with more than they usually did me.
And it seems for some reason to have held me to a more rigid standard than they did the other children.
You're not so sure you were a pet in any sense,
but more that the family situation seemed to hold you to pretty high standards.
M-hm.
That's just what has occurred to me;
and that other people could sorta make mistakes, or do things as children that were naughty, or "that was just a boyish prank," or "that was just what you might expect"
but Alice wasn't supposed to do those things.
M-hm.
With somebody else it would just be just, oh, be a little naughtiness;
but as far as you were concerned, it shouldn't be done.
That's really the idea I've had.
I think the whole business of my standards, or my values, is one that I need to think about rather carefully,
since I've been doubting for a long time whether I even have any sincere ones.
M-hm.
Not sure whether you really have any deep values which you are sure of.
M-hm,
M-hm.
You've been doubting that for some time.
Well,
I've experienced that before.
Though one thing, when I make decisions I don't have -
I don't think -
It seems that some people have - have quite steady values that they can weigh things against when they want to make a decision.
Well,
I don't,
and I haven't had,
and I guess I'm an opportunist.  .
I do what seems to be the best thing to do at the moment,
and let it go at that.
You have no certain measuring rods that you can use.
Yes.
M-hm.
That's what I feel.
Is our time about up,
Mr. L?
Well,
I think there are several minutes more.
Sasha!
That's the third time I've asked what happened to the remote control  ,
and I'm getting frustrated.
I didn't hear you, 'cause I'm reading.
Do you mind?
Ah,
c'mon.
I practically shouted in your ear.
You're just grumpy and wanting to start trouble 'cause you ate that dumb stuff for breakfast.
And now low blood sugar has vacuumed all the energy from your brain.
That's all you know, low blood sugar all the time
-- you've got sugar on the brain.
And you're a vacuum brain.
Maybe I'm imagining it,
but it seems like you've been moody for the last hour.
Usually you don't get so annoyed when my shots go wild.
I really threw some ugly ones,
but I've done it before
and all I got was pity -- not being called "stupid" or "ox paws."
Maybe your body needs some more fuel.
Did you remember to do a good breakfast?
Mom made me some French toast,
but it was just too yucky inside,
so I had orange juice and stuff.
Stuff?
A couple of cookies.
Well,
you know,
that's not gonna nourish you all the way to lunch
-- maybe I'd better make you a cheese sandwich now.
It could be something else,
but a bad breakfast might be giving you a bad mood.
I can't be sure that's it, 'cause --
Ah,
c'mon,
you CAN be sure.
I'm sure.
You're just trying to say it nice so I'll understand.
Their damn ladder-climbing is a nuisance to everybody.
That burning ambition fills their lives and they simply stop thinking creatively.
I get bored with these kids always worrying about getting ahead.
Every one of 'em is boring, even --
Why don't you tell 'em that they're hurting their careers by trying to be inventive on a rushed, ambitious schedule?
Tell 'em?
Listen,
Lou,
I spend half my time nagging 'em to put scientific curiosity up, uh, ahead of publishing.
When I talk about science over job security, they say it's like committing academic suicide.
God,
they must think I'm old fashioned.
Oh,
I know they don't say it,
but it's obvious they think I'm living in the '50s and don't appreciate the pressue they're under.
I really do.
But both of my post-docs and most of my grad students just want to publish prematurely
They even want to to it with half-assed data.
... They're not driven to get to the bottom of things.
Maybe they need to watch you work more closely and learn the pitfalls,
Marie.
I've been taking Laurie through all my struggles with the adolescent study.
I showed her my false starts, the dead ends, and how some spurious correlations got me barking up the wrong tree.
She says that's helped her comb her data more carefully before she writes.
Every Thursday morning last quarter I took the whole bunch of 'em through every lost battle we had on the coping styles project.
God,
they still came up with crap.
I don't know what's going on.
How can I help them?
Am I too demanding?
Are these kids scared and I don't see it?
Have they lost their curiosity?
They're supposed to be gifted researchers
and all they think about is quick publications to get promotions.
Career development above all.
Honest, I'm getting so sick of the whole thing.
Listen,
Marie,
you've just gotta see that they can't survive being like you.
They can't all be as meticulous as you.
They don't have your security, your tenure, your talent.
They don't have your experience yet.
And it's time for you to stop aggravating yourself and getting all exhausted and everything over the fact that these kids don't have the leisure or whatever.
... They don't have to turn out impeccable, inventive articles.
You've got to accept the fact that only, uh, maybe one of twenty will end up doing something really useful.
You're right,
Lou.
They're still green and scared,
but it, it tears me apart to see, uh, what's happening in the journals.
Our field is getting so self-absorbed, so political, and proliferated with this useless, ritualistic research, everyone wanting to do their version of every damn thing.
It's a hell of a time to have to retire.
I was hoping to get just a few, just a couple of young people around me who'd have what it takes to buck the trend.
That's all.
It's an awful situation.
This the first time I've been teary since Edward died.
What are we to do when you invite us here and then you drive big cars as if we with small cars are not existing?
Why are you so sure it's the big car's fault?
But there is truth to this thing of these people who love the cars grandissimos ostentatious.
how do you say,
They think that theirs is the road.
We have a few grande uglies in Buenos Aires,
but you have so many.
Don't look at me.
I've got an old Fiat that me and my boyfriend keep together with bent coathangers,
and I wouldn't trade it for one of those gas-guzzling Cadillacs.
Wonderful!
You honor my country by being a Fiat owner,
but maybe for you it should have been a Ferrari or a Maserati.
Strange you should say that.
I was just about to buy one of each
but they looked too grandissimo.
Us Americans don't enjoy the ostentation of $50,000 exotic cars,
so I've selected a tastefully dented '76 Fiat with five forward speeds.
Ah,
I see!
a smart lady!
You don't depend on the automatic.
They're an insult to --
Automatic transmissions.
Yes.
You people love them -- big, long, automatic Cadillacs that look like, uh, a living room inside.
how do you say,
Americans don't drive the cars,
they live in them.
I've noticed how visitors from other countries put Americans down for being preoccupied with bigger is better,
and you make fun of our cars, dishwashers, and technology.
It seems as if, ah, maybe there's a jealousy.
Do you think?
Is true.
We envy sometimes your technology,
but your reputation is also deserving.
we have curvy roads
how do you say,
and the gas costs so much,
so we learn to negotiate corners, like skiing.
Like art is driving, a skill requiring the shifing and a nimble car.
We are proud of how good is the handling of our cars.
But you people are rich
and have freeways
and drive in straight lines
-- no art.
Your cars are clumsy
and you think first about how they look.
In other countries, they think first about how they handle.
Sad to say,
Americans with their freeways and money are superficial with cars because they only know the surface of them.
I done been here all day.
I know you have.
You been here longer than anybody
No,
I went outside for a while.
Have a seat,
Mr. L--, ...
What can I do for you?
Well,
I had a appointment to come back today.
Alright.
Are you feeling well?
Naw,
I believe by blood is up ... a little bit high.
Are you ribs healing up?
They doing fine.
No pain in your ribs anymore?
Well,
a little pain, but...
Hurt you to take a deep breath?
Okay.
Yeah,
I believe my pressure is up,
that's all.
Why do you say that?
Cause I have them fainting spells.
You have fainting spells.
You know,
you know them dizzy spells,
you know like.
When did you get dizzy?
You know, I...
How long ago?
Been, been a week now.
I started to come in last week.
You been dizzy for a whole week?
It just, just comes over me once in a while.
When does it come over you?
Whenever I ... go to get up.
Okay.
Did you fall down?
Not yet.
You didn't hit the floor?
Okay.
... Alright,
150 over 90.
That's pretty good.
Will you stand up and let me take it again?
Okay.
Pretty fancy blue jeans you got there.
These things cost too much, though.
160 over 110.
Did you get dizzy that time?
Didn't get dizzy that time?
No.
Okay.
Only thing I am dizzy about ... being hungry.
Yeah,
I can imagine.
Have a seat there.
Let me listen to your neck again.
... That dizziness bother you a lot?
Mmm-huh,
it did last week, a whole lots.
But this week you are okay?
Mmm,
pretty good.
You been taking all of your medicine?
Ah,
yeah.
Okay.
I think your blood pressure is good, for right now.
How old are you again?
Ummm,
I am way up yonder.
I was born in 1906,
I think.
1906,
so you're about 60 years old 70 years old.
Um hmm.
Okay.
You got time to let us take a rib X-ray today, to let us see if they are healed up?
Or do you want to do that another day?
On a Thursday, another day.
Another day?
When can you come back?
I am hungry as a dog.
Okay.
When can you come back?
Mmm,
next week.
Okay.
... I've got to go home
and cook myself.
Why is that?
Uh,
Madam, she had, she left me there.
She did?
Why come she did that?
You know why,
I told you that.
She gone do that...
It didn't make no difference...
... I wondered if we took X-rays of your ribs already,
didn't we?
Yes,
sir.
A repeat one.
You came back here on the 21st.
See if I can find that report.
Here it is.
... Yeah,
we need to take another one some day here.
You want to come back in a week for that?
Okay.
Which side was you broken on?
Left side?
Left side.
Okay.
... This is for when you come back,
alright?
Okay.
Now you need any more blood pressure medicine?
... Need more?
I think so.
... pretty low.
Okay.
I got enough of the rest of it.
... Put potassium?
Yes,
sir.
Okay.
You need more of that?
Naw,
I got a half..   might near half a bottle.
You want a half a bottle?
I got a...
Or a whole bottle?
Uh,
a whole bottle'd be okay.
Okay.
Now I won't have to do it again as soon.
I take it every morning.
... Phew,
that's some bad stuff.
Yeah,
I know,
got to give it to you.
Thanks for waiting,
Mr. L--.
You can go home
and get you something to eat.
Come back next week,
and we will X-ray you.
Okay?
Okay.
Here is your medicines.
Your prescriptions are inside your chart.
Got them?
... Ohh!!
... seem like my steps are getting a little shorter.
Yeah,
I can tell.
So, it's Christmas,
and where's my Mary?
I, uh, felt weird,
you know.
When this time of year rolls around, I keep expecting my daughter and everybody together,
and I get so down.
Keep having to tell myself she is ... not here.
Not here.
It's not,
I can't cope with it sometimes.
I want my little girl so much.
Can't get rid of wanting it so bad.
It won't block out.
Don't you think it's time to stop fighting the feelings and sorta let them happen?
Wouldn't it be better during Chris-- uh, during the holidays, to tell yourself the feelings are gonna come and make pain, and, they're gonna go too?
you know,
Well,
I tried saying to myself, "Hey, it's only a holiday just a tradition I'm hooked on.  So it'll feel terrible and pass over."
But then when it actually comes down on me, the pain drops me to my knees.
I forget it'll, like, stop, that the pain will end.
Yeah,
that's true.
It's easy to say you're gonna talk yourself out of it, then really talk yourself out of a bad place -- sorta when ya --
I just have to let it happen, tell myself that's just the way it's gonna be and wait 'til March,
uh -- March is,
it's our month together cause Carl goes, uh, to --
Oh,
God
it's so unfair
so she's my own baby,
You know,
there's this poet who wrote this book of poems about losing custody of his little girl and called it Heart's Needle.
And in the front it has this old Irish poem, about a man who's worked himself into a frenzy 'cause he's lost just everything.
See,
a messenger is telling him about how his house burned and his wife is dead -- and everything almost is gone;
he's sorta, um, reeling when the messenger finally tells him that his only daughter is gone.
This guy says, "Ay! That's the needle in the heart."
Well,
this thing is the needle in my heart
and it's gonna kill me if I can't cut the pain.
Gotta figure some way to take away some of the pain.
Couldn't you take some of the pain away by making your own tradition and doing your own damn Christmas in March?
Your Mary won't care.
Why can't you turn December 25th into any day you please?
I'd really like to talk about my feelings about being an experimental subject.
You would?
Yeah.
Why don't you?
Yeah.
I really get peeved by having them required.
Okay.
Why don't we talk about that then?
I liked ...
well ...
I didn't want to talk about basketball,
and I didn't like ...
No.
I didn't want to talk about that.
I don't,
and my feelings really hadn't gelled about the presidential candidates.
Well,
I like that.
Let's talk about that.
Who made up all the requirements?
Are they a joint decision by the psych department?
The requirement for being an experimental subject?
Mm-hm.
I believe there's a subjects committee,
and they have to do things within a general ethics code,
but the general departmental requirement is because they need subjects
and there's no other way to get subjects.
But how accurate do you think your results would be if you use people who are forced to participate?
I know ...
Do you feel coerced?
Forced to participate?
Yeah,
well,
I'm having to skip a lab this afternoon and make it up next week in order to get ...
To get your credit.
You're a psych 10 student?
Yes,
I'm a psych 10 student,
but it's really hard for me to get my hours,
because I have to come all the way over here just to look.
They put them up haphazardly,
and there's not a system.
Lots of times I'm coming over here at night,
and it takes half an hour and then half an hour for the experiment.
It makes me ill.
I know ...
It makes you resentful?
Yeah,
it does.
It takes me half an hour for a half-hour experiment.
If I happen to luck up and get it, then I have to drive over here at night,
and it's dark and cold and uh ...
You feel that you're in danger because you're a woman?
I don't feel it's so dangerous as ...
It's just inconvenient.
It's very inconvenient.
I'm tired.
I generally just go through the experiments,
and I know I'm not giving accurate results.

I'm not trying to.
I don't feel like making myself.
Like, if I was taking a test, I'd force myself to focus my attention on it,
but in the experiments I'm just barely reading.
What about the debriefing?
Do you pay attention after the experiment?
I'm just sitting there saying, "I don't give a damn; I just want to get out of here."
Yeah.
Do you see another reason why the department want psych 10 students to be experimental subjects?
I see the reason.
Maybe they want them to have some experience in an experimental lab.
Take part in the ongoing research taking place here.
It's also like an invasion of your privacy.
Yeah.
I'm just sitting here for half an hour now.
That means I'll have to do that 10 times.
Whatever I'm going to learn in one half hour, it's really for the psych department.
You don't think you learned anything you didn't learn in the first half hour?
No.
Not through getting all these different experimental experiences?
No,
I don't think that's helped me any.
I'm not a psych major,
and I don't intend to be.
Maybe if I was interested I could talk to the experimenter,
but I just don't care to.
This is my last semester,
and I just want to get through.
Which experiment is this for you?
This will make my third hour.
I'll have to do two more hours.
How do you feel right now about being in this one?
Do you hate this one?
Well,
I don't particularly hate this one.
I'm not as peeved as I have been.
I'm not as tired.
That makes a lot of difference.
When I'm tired I know I don't give good results.
I know a lot of people just make designs on their papers.
They don't even read the question.
Really?
Now you know that they don't get good results.
Do you think they try to screw up the experiments?
I know people who try to screw up the experiment.
I know a great deal of people who try to screw up the results.

No.
They don't even read the questions.
They just make designs on their papers randomly and haphazardly.
So how can the results be valid?
That's a real problem.
So why do they even do them?
Couldn't they just limit the requirement to two hours or something?
By the time I get through ten of these things I'm not very willing to cooperate.
I've been in an experiment,
and I kind of enjoy them.
When I was an undergraduate, I was in a GSR experiment,
and I was quite enthusiastic,
because I had never been in an experiment before.
You weren't forced to be in it,
were you?
No,
I wasn't forced to be in it.
You were a psych major?
Yes,
I was a psych major.
See,
you had an interest in it.
You're interested in it for your own benefit.
I'm not interested in it.
I'm taking this course because I have to take this course.
It's just a requirement.
Not only did you feel you have to be in the experiment,
but you had to be in the course,
and your feelings have to do with the whole thing of what the requirement is.
I don't really mind being required to be in the course.
I just feel this extra stuff is unnecessary.
You don't think this is truly an integral part of the course.
No,
I feel like it's a little click -- a little Catch-22 attached to it.
You don't get any credit.
It breaks up your time
and conflicts with tests.
But because we've got you in a corner, you have to put up with it.
There's nothing you can do.
Okay,
what can I do?
I can not participate.
Then it goes on my record as an F.
There is one thing you can do.
Okay.
I could write a paper.
Yeah.
That's not a reasonable alternative.
It's not?
No!
Design a research experiment?
Tell me more about it.
That's interesting.
You know perfectly.
No,
I don't.
Tell me.
I've had people to take it.
That take the alternative?
Yeah.
Write a research paper that would take 20-30 hours?
No,
it doesn't.
Have you looked into it?
I've looked into it.
It's just two pages.
Our instructor pointed out that it would be a lot more work than it would be to do the experiments.
Dr. King pointed out that ...
Dr. King is your instructor?
Yes.
If we chose that route it would be more work.
Uh huh.
A two page paper?
You mean I've been through all this shit for nothing?
Well,
I think you have to read something experimental and write a paper on it.
But he implied ...
Just a critique or something.
He doesn't grade it?
It's just a matter of doing it or not doing it?
I'm not sure.
I know people who have taken that alternative.
Can you mix it up in any way?
Some people do.
I've heard of people doing it.
That's something you could take up with David Drachman.
Do you feel better now?
God.
If I could have done that I would have gone one weekend
and gotten all this garbage over with.
How does that make you feel about being in this experiment?
It makes me feel like getting up and walking out.
Really?
Do you really feel like getting up and walking out?
Well ...
What would happen if you walked out?
I don't know.
You could if you wanted to.
That's right.
I'd be disappointed if you did.
Oh,
sure.!
No,
because I like being a subject in this experiment,
and I want to find out what they're going to say to us.
I don't like being in experiments,
and I don't like coming over here.
They're inconvenient,
and I don't like the idea that someone is looking at you and trying to figure you out.
Psych you out.
Yeah.
They don't have the ability to look inside your brain,
but I don't like being looked at under a microscope.
Because it's an invasion of your privacy.
It is an invasion of privacy,
and I don't like being poked and picked at like an insect.
Miss B----?
Hmm?
Miss B----?
I'm Dr. H----.
How are you today?
Terrible.
Terrible?
Why are you terrible?
I got a cold,

No?
And your bowels have been okay?
Yeah.
And are you hurting anywhere else?

And in here?
And the stuffy nose.

Okay.

Um-um.

And this has been going on for about two days now?
Have you been feeling flushed at all?
Well,
last night, I got real sick last night.
Okay,
what happened when you got real sick?
Um, just that my nose got stopped up,
and my head went to hurting
and everything was dizzy.

Your ears getting blocked off?
Um-hmm.
Um-um.
They hurt you at all?
You feel any lumps coming on your throat like swollen glands?
Nothing like that?
Um-um.
Okay.
How old are you?
23.
23.
Have you been pretty healthy?
Um-hum.
Okay.
Have you ever been in the hospital before?
When I was small, about six years old.
For what?
My eyes.
What was the problem?
Crossed.
Okay.
Okay.
Um, are you on any medication right now?
Are you allergic to any medicines?
Okay.
Have you had a lot of problem with strep throats or sore throats?
And have you had your tonsils out?
No?
Okay.
You living at home?
Um-hum.
You are with your family?
And how many brothers and  sisters do you have?
Six.
Six.
And anyone else sick at home?
Um-um.
Everybody gone.
They're all gone?
Yeah,
school.
And how about your folks?
They both home?
They there.
They ain't sick.
They're pretty healthy.
Nothing runs in the family?
Okay.
Have you been sleeping alright?
Um, yeah.
Have you been eating?
Um-hum.
You have been?
Okay.
I'll tell you what.
Let me see if they took your temperature here today.
Have you ever been to a doctor before?
To have your blood pressure checked or for your employment physicals or things like that?
Just a regular check-up.
That's all.
When's the last time you had a, had a regular check-up?
It was  a week ago.
Where was that?
At the GYN Clinic.
Okay,
have you been having any GYN problems?
Just normal problems.
Problems with your period?
Yes.
Are you on any birth control right now?
Well,
she gave me some to make my period come,
but that's it.
To make your period come regular?
Okay.
What kind of work do you do?
Work with animals.
Okay.
And how long have you been doing that?
For a long time?
Oh,
for about a month now.
This be the sec--,
this be the sec--,
oh,
wait a minute.
This is September,
right?
Um-hum.
Maybe two months.
What kind of animals do you work with?
Rats and cats and, um, rabbits.
Okay,
and, uh, you're handling them a lot?
No,
uh-uh.
No?
Doing
Just feeding them.
Just feeding them
and so you don't have any problems with getting bitten.
You haven't been bitten or scratched lately?
Un-hun.
No rashes lately?
Okay.
Tell you what.
Why don't we take a look at your, at your throat?
I'll have you change into a gown.
Okay?
You can leave your pants on.
Just take your shirt off.  So I can take a listen to your breathing.
Let me ask you one other thing.
The headaches that you've been having, can you tell me about them a little bit?
Well,
I know I have headaches from not wearing my glasses all the time.
Um-hum.
And just, I, I know I have migraine headaches now and then.
But that's it.
Now what do you mean when you say migraine?
Tension?
Real bad?
Yeah,
real, real bad.
Cause I don't wear my glasses.
I
Okay.
Is that on both sides?
Yes.
Okay.
And do you have any problem with vomiting, or being sick on your stomach?
Or does the light bother your eyes when you're having them?
So then, you've had headaches for a long time, sort of mild headaches.
And is that the kind of headache you're having now?
Pt. Um-um.
How's this one different?
Well,
I don't have a headache.
It's just, like if I lay down now and wake up, cause I got this cold, I be dizzy.
you know,
Um-humm.
I be dizzy about five or ten minutes
and that's it.
Um-humm.
Okay.
Let me leave you a gown.
And I'll have you change into it.
Leave your pants on.
But I'd like you to take the green shirt and the other shirt off,
so I can listen to your heart,
okay?
I'll be with you in one moment.
This shirt opens in the back.
Okay?
Let me show you.
Okay?
It's like a paper towel.
I'll leave it back there for you.
You tell me when you're ready.
What did you do before you had this job?
You can sit right there with your legs over the side.
You mean before I had this job?
Um-hum,
what kind of work did you do?
Oh,
I worked in the labs.
You worked in the labs for a while, then?
Umm-hmm.
Umm-hmm.
You get sick a lot?
Uh-uh.
Okay.
I'm just gonna feel under your arm.
Okay.
The same thing.
I'm just gonna feel the glands in your neck.
Okay.
You think this is getting worse?
What?
This cold.
No.
It gets worse at night.
Are you not sleeping?
Is that what bothers you?
I cough
and my nose just gets stopped up.
Okay.
Has it been all stopped up
or has it been running loose too?
Um-hmm.
Loose too.

Okay.
Let me just take a listen to your breathing for a second.
Take a deep breath for me.
Good.
And again.
again.
Good.
I'm gonna take a look in your ear.

.
Okay.
I'm gonna go back
and take another look at this one.
What I'm seeing is that this ear has some fluid in it.
And it's probably fluid that's caught in here that makes it feel stuffed up.
Okay.
Open your mouth wide for me.
Say ahh.
Say ahh again.
there?
Uh-uh.
Doesn't hurt?
Okay.
And down here.
Doesn't bother you?
Okay.
Why don't you go ahead and get your clothes back on
and I'll sit and talk to you for a second.
I'm gonna be out
Okay.
Let me explain to you what I've seen.
Um, it looks like what you've got is congestion.
And your eardrum, is sort of pulled back tight.
you know,
we talk about the eardrum that we see at the back of the canal,
And how that happens is the tube that leads to it gets swollen and gets closed off.
It's usually not open like this,
but it gets all swollen up.
Um-hum.
It closes off,
and then, the ear comes back
and there's like a vacuum there.
And it's real tight
and they hurt
and they're pulled back.
And that's cause of all the congestion that you're having,
and it's probably giving you the feeling of dizziness.
Your throat doesn't look real bad.
It doesn't look like you have a strep throat.
An you may even have a little bit of sinus problems on top of that.
It's hard to tell.
What I'd like to do is start you on some nosedrops.
Now, there's not a bad infection in there.
And the nosedrops should help just to relieve this congestion
and should help open up your nose. So that you can breathe.
Okay?
Um, they do different things for different people,
and some people they help more than others.
When I use it it usually does fine for me.
When other people try it it doesn't do as well.
But I expect, especially with the nose problem, that this will really help you a lot.
And once you get that cleared out and your ears cleared out, I think you'll start to feel a lot better.
And I think you should be ready probably to come back tomorrow.
You don't have a fever,
and I don't think it's a bad infection.
So we'll have to see how you do.
Mm-hm
I think it's just a virus.
And if we can get you over this congestion I think you'll feel a lot better.
So, I'll give you the prescription.
Do you need a pharmacy card?
Do you want to charge it,
or how are you gonna handle it?
I'm going to charge it.
Okay.
Then we'll give you a pharmacy card.
And, uh, if you're not better in two days, you can come back
and we'll take another look at you.
But I think you'll probably feel much better with this and be able to work tomorrow.
I'm going to stay out tomorrow to make sure.
Okay.
Now these aren't easy--
have you ever used these drops before?
No.
Okay.
You tilt your head back
and drop two in each nostril.
Okay?
Sometimes it's,
it's good to get a good angle.
And put your head back.
Otherwise they'll run.
Breathe them in.
It's going to sting.
Breathe it in,
hold it in for a second.
Okay?
And then, because you don't want to blow it right out again, breathe in
and hold it in for a while.
It'll work better.
And it'll tell you on the bottle how to take it.
You take it every 4-6 hours, as much as you need.
Do you have any questions at all?
Um-um  .
Okay.
Don't you go giving this to your brothers and sisters.
Or I'll tell them who did it.
Okay?
Okay,
here's your slip.
Let's get you a pharmacy card.
Um, after you get the pharmacy card, the secretary that talked to you about taping just needs to talk to you, just have you look at a paper.
You feel like you can do that for us?
Okay.
Well,
can I have the excuse before you leave?
Yep,
I'm going to fill that for you outside, cause I don't have another sheet of paper.
So why don't you come with me
and we'll fill that out outside.
Guess how many fingers I'm holding up.
Forgot your keys?
You eat a lot of fatty foods, then.
If you go, you'll regret it.
Forget your keys?
Mmhh?
We couldn't get here sooner.
Goodbye, Sam.
You drove home afterwards.
Fuck you.
It feels as if you're always on the line.
You didn't bring a can opener?
You should forget her.
I guess so.
It was like a chest pain.
It's probably your own fault.
I won't do that.
Where are we heading?
You want to go?
Could you?
Could your embarrassment be a way of avoiding conflict?
I see
You may always contact me if things get rough.
My mother and I both came.
We believe in a strong America.
He was my best friend.
He did what?
Whoever is on the mat loves me.
What?
You are doing just fine.
If I'm not mistaken, he was first.
I'm going to check your ears now.
That's right!
Never mind.
You can't lift a car by yourself.
You have diabetes.
We want you to begin this project tomorrow.
We've about exhausted that topic.
Please wash your hands.
Sometimes I'm bored.
That's an awful thing to say.
You will soon discover that the main concern of this book is with the theory underlying inferential methods.
A White House spokesman read the President's response.
Yeah.
Okay.
Dummy!
You and I disagree about cats.
So you still feel sick?
You don't have high blood pressure.
You and I are quite a team.
WHAT!
It's really annoying to me.
So you are retired now?
I think you're just too stupid.
Okay, Sam.
Fish scare me.
You may kiss the bride.
You may have an infection.
I see.
You and I disagree.
We disagree about that.
They never come down to rest.
It stopped working when you dropped it?
Here we go.
No smoking.
They told me to take it easy.
Put on this robe.
You should avoid gaining any more weight.
You stopped where?
I guess you know that they're taping us.
You know I can't stand the sight of snakes.
Dr. Bales.
You can go in now.
You were very frightened.
Me too.
I think all spiders have eight legs.
Which do you prefer?
You and me agree.
I feel absolutely overwhelmed.
I don't know.
Would you hop on the examination table, please?
How?
You must be exhausted.
You love me.
Fine.
Are we ready?
Goodness gracious!
You feel afraid.
Is that so?
Have you ever dreamt you were falling?
You left without him?
Hi there.
Isn't she a beaut!
You say you're too heavy?
I was terrified.
What do you want me to do?
We better not try that.
We are being tape recorded?
You're right.
Are you ready?
You are an angry young man.
You shouldn't work so hard.
This time you're not alone.
You should exercise more
He hit you?
And this.
Hi, George.
I'm going to the library.
Mr. Smith seems normal to me.
Matilda and George and I love you.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself!
Lie down on the mat.
They couldn't come.
I wish you'd slow down.
Right!
Are you saying, then, that you feel both angry and hurt?
I disagree with you.
The cat is on the mat.
I saw the boat.
Could you get me a drink?
My throat hurts.
I agree with you.
They said I was in good shape.
We can?
Uh-huh
We love carrots.
It's a mutual feeling.
You feel like you've been used.
It hasn't come yet.
You wanted chocolate?
We'll send you upstairs for some X-rays.
Try harder.
You're my favorite dancer.
Do you love me?
You're saying, "How can I organize it all for myself?"
You can do anything you set your mind to.
I'd like a beer.
Will you take off your glasses, please?
See if you can lift that leg higher.
We need to begin your physical exam now.
You are identifying with your mother's hostility.
Please pass the carrots.
Fine job.
Let's look at that ear.
Matilda, ...
You have to see this movie.
My father raped me when I was 12 years old.
Hello.
You say you feel nervous.
We disagree.
You're just like Matilda.
George!
Well, ...
Would you like to try on these slacks?
We'll send you upstairs for some X-rays.
We don't seem to know each other very well.
We agree that the plan is sound.
You must be tired.
We won't let you go without a prescription.
You can do it if you want to.
We love you.
You won't regret that.
Everything seems normal.
You are a high-risk person.
I went to see him.
Wouldn't I have been surprised!
Where are you?
Good.
I know the way out.
We are going where?
You may not play in the street.
I love you.
I wonder if you aren't basically afraid of him.
The tumor is malignant.
Howdy.
How are you?
We better get started.
Where is the cat?
You may come back next week.
You disagree with me.
We will look forward to having you on our staff.
You wish you had more money.
Sir?
Once it begins, you can't stop it.
I want a pony.
Let's get going!
My mother and I waited for you.
You can't get this medicine without a prescription.
Hi.
You think that getting away will solve your problems.
If it was a blue one, I would buy it.
We're just like Matilda and George.
Good to see you!
Where?
Mm-hm.
I walked here with Janet.
It was your fault that he left.
We've had a long day.
Now, take five deep breaths, slowly.
Could you?
So what?
Everything seems normal
You ate the carrots.
I'm afraid of spiders.
You feel dizzy when you stand?
Home I ran
Last time we really enjoyed this.
Code this.
Let's talk about this now instead of next week.
You're welcome.
We'll see.
Cream in your coffee?
Thank you.
She loves me.
You know Jimmy, too.
I'm not on time?
Why did you say that?
It's not worth repeating the X-ray.
Farewell forever.
Are you the owner?
I think my blood pressure is 100/60.
You are sure of that?
You bet.
You say the nicest things.
Must be.
Help!
That's right.
Good work.
It's like floating on air.
