Dr: Okay.                                                   IK
    Let me explain to you what I've seen.                   AD
    Um, it looks like what you've got is congestion.        EE
    And your eardrum, is sort of pulled back tight.                                   EE
    you know,                                           RE
    we talk about the eardrum that we see at the back of the canal,                                           DE
    And how that happens is the tube that leads to it gets swollen and gets closed off.                            EE
    It's usually not open like this,                        EE
    but it gets all swollen up.                             EE
Pt: Um-hum.                                                 KK
Dr: It closes off,                                          EE
    and then, the ear comes back                            EE
    and there's like a vacuum there.                        EE
    And it's real tight                                     EE
    and they hurt                                           EI
    and they're pulled back.                                EE
    And that's cause of all the congestion that you're having,                                                 EE
    and it's probably giving you the feeling of dizziness.  EI
    Your throat doesn't look real bad.                      EE
    It doesn't look like you have a strep throat.           EE
    An you may even have a little bit of sinus problems on top of that.                                         IE
    It's hard to tell.                                      ED
    What I'd like to do is start you on some nosedrops.     EE
    Now, there's not a bad infection in there.              EE
    And the nosedrops should help just to relieve this congestion                                              EE
    and should help open up your nose. So that you can breathe.                 EE
    Okay?                                               QQ
    Um, they do different things for different people,      EE
    and some people they help more than others.             EE
    When I use it it usually does fine for me.              ED
    When other people try it it doesn't do as well.         EE
    But I expect, especially with the nose problem, that this will really help you a lot.                        DI
    And once you get that cleared out and your ears cleared out, I think you'll start to feel a lot better. DI
    And I think you should be ready probably to come back tomorrow.                                               DA
    You don't have a fever,                                 IE
    and I don't think it's a bad infection.                 DE
    So we'll have to see how you do.                        CC
Pt: Mm-hm                                                   KK
Dr: I think it's just a virus.                              DE
    And if we can get you over this congestion I think you'll feel a lot better.                               DI
    So, I'll give you the prescription.                     DD

   no,                                                      KC
   I didn't get that idea.                                  DD
Steven:  No?                                                KQ
   Well,                                                    KK
   anyway, I'm glad I told you --                           DD
   I really want to talk to you some more.                  DD
   And it's a relief to let you know how I'm feeling.       ED
   I mean,                                          DD
   it didn't seem fair for you to carry the ball,           ED
   you know,                                                RD
   and that was very kind of you,                           EI
   but you seem,                                            II
   you honestly seem like a neat person.                    II
   And it's so crazy to sit there and let myself be shy.    ED
Dana: (Interrupting) Sure,                                 EI
   I'm glad you told me.                                    DD
   My little brother, Adreas, is real shy.                  EE
   He's a great kid,                                        ED
   gifted long-distance runner,                             EE
   but people give him a hard time because everyone's in a rush nowadays --                                    EE
   they keep cutting him off.                               EE
   That bugs me.                                            ED
Steven.  It bugs me too.                                    EC
   Uh, and the way you can think about your kid brother is, uh, just great.                                      EI
Dana:  Well,                                                KK
   I just see what people can do to him when he's shy,      DD
   and it gets to me because I love him.                    ED
Steven:  That's obvious.                                    EI
   Right now I'm wishing I had a friend like you,           DD
   well,                                                    KK
   uh, ... maybe not exactly a sister -- a friend.          DD
   Yeah.                                                    KD
   A friend.  Like you.                                     DD
